# Diabetes Classification

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying diabetes outcomes based on various health metrics. The dataset used for this project is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/diabetes-factors.

## Overview üìã

The goal of this project is to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, and employ the SGD Classifier for classification tasks. Various metrics like precision, recall, and the F1 score are then used to evaluate the model's performance.

## Highlights from the Project üåü

- Data Visualization using scatter plots and histograms.
- Data preprocessing using pipelines and column transformers to handle scaling.
- SGD Classifier training and evaluation.
- Model performance evaluation using metrics like precision, recall, and the F1 score.
- Precision-recall trade-off analysis with visualization.

## Results üìä

The model performance was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. Precision, recall, and the F1 score were computed to understand the balance and trade-off between identifying true positives and avoiding false positives.

Note: This is a fictional dataset for demonstration purposes. Actual model results and performance may vary based on the quality and characteristics of the dataset.
